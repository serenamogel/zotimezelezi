Ethnicity, Nationality, Family</span></h2><p>Before we explore the wonderful love story of Alexei Brovarnik and his wife Loren Brovarnik, let’s get to know Alexei a little more with some wikis.</p><p>Alexei was an Israeli citizen until he met his American wife and moved to the United States. Born in Ukraine, his parents moved to Israel when he was 11 years old.</p><p>Young Alexei grew up in Nazareth Illit, Israel. Alexei’s exact birthday was not known. However, according to numerous sources on the Internet (including the Wikipedia article of 90 Day Fiance), he was 32 years old by the beginning of 2020.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Alexei_Brovarnik_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Alexei Brovarnik? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>When it came to a profession, Alexei Brovarnik was a man of modest ambitions and wanted to work for jobs that benefited people and played a role in making society a healthier, safer place. Although his wife wanted him to be a model, given how handsome he was, Alexei himself wanted nothing more than to be a firefighter, a paramedic, or a police officer.</p><p>In the beginning, Alexei and his wife were not very well off. However, after appearing on Fiance’s 90th day, their fortunes swung up and their net worth passed the $300 thousand mark. <strong>Alexei Brovarnik is very tall at a height of well over 6 feet.</strong></p><table style=height:100%;width:100% data-tablestyle=MsoTableGrid data-tablelook=1696><tbody><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Estimated Net Worth in 2023</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>$300 thousand&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Previous Year’s Net Worth (2022)</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>$300 thousand</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Annual Salary</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Under Review.</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td data-celllook=0><span data-contrast=auto>Income Source</span><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></td><td data-celllook=0><span data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559740":259}'>Celebrity</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Alexei_Brovarnik_8211_Relationship_Girlfriend>Alexei Brovarnik – Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Finally, let’s talk about the love story of Alexei-Loren. Yes, Alexei’s popular American wife was Loren Goldstone. Alexei met Loren while she was on a trip to Israel, and he worked as a doctor in Israel. The two of them instantly hit it off and began dating.</p><p>That happened at the end of 2013. Later in 2015, Alexei moved to the United States with a K-1 visa to be with Loren. It was this process that was registered on 90 Days of Fiance: the 90 days between Alexei’s move to the US and her marriage.</p><p>After 90 Day Fiance rose their success, they also appeared together in the show’s other spinoffs 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After, 90 Day Fiance: Pillow Talk, and 90 Day Fiance: Our Journey So Far.</p><p>After getting married in the US for the sake of a visa, the couple also got married in Israel about a year later. Three years after they got married, Alexei and Loren were pregnant with their first child and were expecting it in mid-2020. Later, Loren would joke that she had been knocked on purpose only so that Alexei would be hers forever.</p><p>Alexei Brovarnik, and his wife Loren, has been playing with a baby until their arrival around 2020. Meanwhile, Alexei was granted U.S. citizenship, and the couple seemed to have settled in their tiny American family.</p><h2><span id=Wife_gives_birth_to_her_Firstborn>Wife gives birth to her Firstborn</span></h2><p>Alexei Brovarnik became the first parent after Loren Brovarnik’s wife gave birth to her first bundle of joy—a baby boy—in the spring of 2020. The TLC stars broke the news via Instagram. <strong>Born on April 14, 2020</strong>, Alexei and Loren’s son—or BabyBrov, as they called him—weighed five pounds and ten ounces.</p><p>Besides, it was 19 inches long. Per the IG update, Alexei and his wife decided to announce the name of their son in the coming days. True to their words, the name of the child was revealed as Shai Josef Brovarnik on 21 April 2020. According to Loren, Shai was a present.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Belle Kirschner</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Chloe Saxon</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Candy Loving</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Claire Cottrill</span></a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Raman Subba Row</a></h3>Raman Subba Row estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
