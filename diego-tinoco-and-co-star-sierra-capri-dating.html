The truth, however, is much different from the on-screen drama.&nbsp;Tinoco claims to be unmarried and completely focused on his professional job.</p><h2>Sierra Capri Is Diego Tinoco’s “Best Scene Partner”</h2><p>When he initially appeared in the supernatural blockbuster series Teen Wolf in season 6, the Hollywood hottie drew a lot of attention. His breakthrough role, though, was as Cesar Diaz in the Spanish Netflix series On My Block. His love interest in the series is Monse, portrayed by Sierra Capri. Their characters’ relationship was so intense that many hypothesized that they might be dating in real life. Unfortunately, according to Distractify, the couple was not dating when the cameras stopped recording. They do, however, share a great deal of respect and affection for one another as friends. Tinoco told Teen Vogue that Capri was the finest film companion he could have wished for in an interview. He said that working with her made him feel more at ease in front of the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Diego-Tinoco-1.jpg><p>Tinoco and his co-star were both sad when their characters’ relationships ended in the second season of the show. Notebook Style, the actor, indicated that he would go for Cesar and Monse to continue dating and have a happy ending. I suppose I’d want to see them together forever, happily ever after, like in The Notebook. Reciprocating the sentiment, the actress expressed identical views—even going a step farther. She expressed her want to see their personalities develop beyond dating. She wished for them to marry and have children together.</p><h2>Diego Tinoco is concentrating on furthering his career.</h2><p>Despite claims that he is dating his co-star, the California native looks to remain single for the time being.&nbsp;According to his comments, he is only getting started with his acting career. As a result, the gifted actor intends to avoid relationships in order to concentrate on his burgeoning profession in Hollywood. He plans on spending time with his family and friends.</p><p>Nonetheless, he admitted in an interview with Seventeen that his celebrity obsession was actress Ana De Armas. He expressed his desire to collaborate with her eventually. While De Armas is the Netflix star’s current obsession, he also said that Ariana Grande was his first crush.</p><h2>Tinoco’s First Film</h2><p>Tinoco is now focusing on his profession. R#J, his debut film, has been signed. The film is a modern-day retelling of Shakespeare’s timeless classic Romeo and Juliet. Carey Williams directed it, while Timur Bekmambetov and Igor Today produced it. In December 2020, the On My Block star expressed his enthusiasm about the film through an Instagram post.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibop2XpHq1tc2omqhlkaOxbq%2FOZqqtmaJiwKqx0auYZpuRpb%2BqecOaq6Kml2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./issei-sagawa-kobe-cannibal-raped-murdered-and-ate-woman-but-walked-free-dies-age-73.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Issei Sagawa: Kobe Cannibal raped, murdered and ate woman but walked free dies age 73">&larr;
