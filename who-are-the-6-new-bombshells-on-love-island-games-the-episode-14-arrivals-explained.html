In this cheeky new iteration, romance will meet reality as fan-favorite islanders are faced with both team and couples’ challenges, all while navigating dating, eliminations, recoupling, dramatic arrivals, and new competition twists and turns like never before.”</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Beginning with stunners like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justine Ndiba</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cely Vazquez</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Imani Wheeler</a>, new contestants have entered the villa every few days, including head-turners like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Boerner</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan Barton-Hanson</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Middlebrooks</a>, and more.

Entering the&nbsp;villa on day one and immediately coupling up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Timmy Pandolfi</a>, the duo coasted their way to finale night (despite exploring relationships with Jeff Christian Jr. and Bria Bryant in between), causing them to be crowned the champions of Love Island: USA season 4.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Despite exploring a relationship with one another outside of the villa, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zeta and Timmy called it quits in January of 2023</a>, with Zeta sharing some red flags she saw in Timmy in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one-on-one interview with Murad Merali</a>, all of which began just moments after they won&nbsp;Love Island: USA season 4.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Since their breakup, Zeta seems to be happier than ever, attending red carpets like the Kids Choice Awards, the British Fashion Awards, and more, as well as various movie premieres. She is even a Fashion Nova model, posting dozens of sexy solo shots on her&nbsp;Instagram profile&nbsp;(which has amassed over 600,000 followers).</p><p data-characters=87 data-current-count=87 data-injectable=false>Her newest endeavor?

Coupling up on day one in the villa and remaining faithful to one another until the very end (with the exception of the infamous Casa Amor week, where Deb coupled up with Kyle Fraser) Deb and Jesse made the decision to pursue a relationship with one another outside of the villa after their Love Island: USA journey came to a close, however, it was short-lived.</p><p data-characters=752 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The duo called it quits in December of 2022</a>, just four months after&nbsp;Love Island: USA&nbsp;wrapped (and one month before Zeta and Timmy’s split). Deb and Jesse announced via their respective Instagram stories that they are better off as friends rather than romantic partners — “I just wanted to let you all know that Jesse and I have made the difficult decision to go our separate ways… We work better as friends and will always have love and respect for each other. We will always cherish our memories and time together as we went through this incredible experience… We are so grateful for all of the love and support and hope you will continue to support us in our individual journeys,” Deb shared with her 251,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Despite failing to find her perfect match, Deb is still extremely invested in the&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;franchise, hosting a finale party for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season five of&nbsp;Love Island: USA</a>, attending a pop-up villa for&nbsp;Love Island: USA in Austin, and now&nbsp;competing on the inaugural season of&nbsp;Love Island Games.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scott van-der-Sluis (Love Island: UK season 10 and Love Island: USA season 5)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Scott-Love-Island-Games.png><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=489 data-injectable=true>Entering the villa as a bombshell on day 11, Scott van-der-Sluis had a rather lackluster journey on Love Island: UK. Attempting to form a connection with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Agbaje</a>, Jess Harding, Amber Wise, Abi Moores, and more, Scott found himself unlucky in love time and time again during his time on the hit competition show, causing him to be dumped from the villa on day 56, just short of the finale. Fortunately for viewers, his time within the Love Island franchise did not end there…</p><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>Almost instantaneously after being dumped from the villa, Scott caught a flight to Fiji to join Love Island: USA as a bombshell as well, where he found himself failing to find his perfect match for the second time.

Mitch had quite the journey on season 3 of Love Island: Australia, remaining faithful to Tina Provis throughout his time in the villa (with the exception of day 10, where he coupled up with Emily Ward and Tina coupled up with Taku Chimwaza), coasting them all the way to finale night and earning them the win.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Just three months after Love Island: Australia&nbsp;wrapped, Mitch and Tina took to their respective Instagram stories to announce their split (amid allegations that Mitch cheated on Tina with Emily post-filming), however, the pair got back together with one another shortly after. With both individuals returning for season 4 of Love Island: Australia, the duo rekindled their romance in the villa, however they broke up once and for all shortly after their second time on Love Island: Australia came to a close.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>With both Mitch and Tina appearing on the inaugural season of Love Island Games, our fingers are crossed that the two lovebirds find their way back to one another.

As mentioned, Tina Provis entered the villa alongside Mitch during episode 14, adding another set of exes to the villa (along with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cely Vazquez and Johnny Middlebrooks</a>, of course).</p><p data-characters=732 data-current-count=949 data-injectable=true>As mentioned, Tina and Mitch took to Instagram to announce their breakup back in January of 2022, despite getting back together a few months later — “This is difficult for me, as my instinct is to deal with this in private, however, I have been living a very public life, and for that reason, I want to speak openly on here so that I never have to address it on the internet again. It’s with a very sad, heavy heart that I tell you guys, Mitch and I are no longer together. I’m so devastated to be sharing this news with you and I am still processing the situation. Sadly, this was not our time and we agreed that the best decision for us right now is to part ways,” Tina shared with her 168,000 followers.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>While Tina appears to be living her best life, modeling for brands like Hello Molly, attending sporting events like the FIFA Women’s World Cup, and more based on her Instagram profile, she might just find someone to share it with on the inaugural season of Love Island Games.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Who knows?

Aurelia entered the villa on day one (just moments after the re-coupling ceremony), giving her the opportunity to “steal” whichever islander she wanted for herself. She decided to couple up with Henrik Stoltenberg (“stealing” him from Anna Iff), however, their relationship did not last long.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>After breaking up with Henrik, Aurelia decided to self-eliminate from the beloved competition series on day 25, as she failed to make a connection with any of the other contestants besides Henrik — poor thing!</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>With the sneak peek of episode 15 teasing a relationship between her and Johnny Middlebrooks on Love Island Games, could Aurelia finally find her perfect match?
