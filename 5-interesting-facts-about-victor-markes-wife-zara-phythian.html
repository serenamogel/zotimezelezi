Previous to Martial Arts and Hollywood Fame</h2><p>Phythian was born in a Christian family on May 10, 1984, in Nottingham Country, England. She was reared with three sisters by parents whose identities are still unknown to the world.&nbsp;She began learning Shotokan Karate at the age of seven and then switched to Tae Kwon Do. Although she is presently an actor, she is most recognized for her martial arts background.</p><h2>2. Champion of Martial Arts</h2><p>She advanced to 2nd Dan before reaching her adolescence.&nbsp;She was finally brought to Nottingham’s School of Champions, a well-known Martial Arts facility. As a teenager, Phythian became interested in Tae Kwon Do, Shaolin Wu Shu, Kickboxing, and Freestyle Karate. She was also a 13-time multi-style world champion and fought in national and international combat circuits. She was the first British martial artist to be admitted into the International Karate and Kickboxing Hall of Fame in 2006.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/zara-phythian-1.jpg alt="zara phythian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>3. Getting Famous in Hollywood</h2><p>A producer noticed her for a film during one of her tournaments. She was given a part in a movie while competing and won four US National Belt Titles.&nbsp;She returned to the United States for an indie Sci-Fi film, Crops, which was released in 2006, and discovered a love for acting. Phythian stopped competing and concentrated on her acting career.</p><h2>4. Married To Victor Marke</h2><p>She was already in a relationship with Marke at the time. According to the Mirror, Marke was 37 when he met his wife, who was 14 when she entered his program in Nottingham.&nbsp;They started dating when she was 19, and although their relationship sparked speculation, the Doctor Strange actor denied she was “infatuated.”&nbsp;It is unknown when the pair married or whether they had children since they are quite quiet about their lives.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/zara-phythian-2.jpg alt="zara phythian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>5. Allegations of Sexual Assault</h2><p>Unfortunately, the couple’s lives are no longer private, since they have lately been accused of sexual assault.&nbsp;According to accounts, the pair mistreated their martial arts student together when the victim was 13 years old. The victim, who is now an adult, said the attack occurred after the pair drugged her with a drink and the actress challenged her to do graphic acts for her spouse.</p><p>They also said that her spouse threatened to break her kneecaps if they came out about the assault.&nbsp;These charges occurred between 2005 and 2008, while the couple was still unmarried. The pair has rejected all charges and is presently battling in court to establish their innocence.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZqGeqbKzsdKtoKefXZuupMDSZpibp6Wpere1wq2mq2Wdlr%2BssdJmrqKelWLHor7AZqehsaSdtqK6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./costas-mandylor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Costas Mandylor  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">&larr;
