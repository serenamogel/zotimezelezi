He is a former professional football player in the position of quarterback, who currently works as a network color commentator – commenting on and analysing plays in football games. It is worth saying that he is also one of the hosts at the morning sports radio show “Boomer and Carton” aired on WFAN. Boomer Esiason has been accumulating his net worth primarily playing football professionally for 14 years. He was named UPI AFC Player of the Year (1988), Walter Payton Man of Year (1995), AFC Champion with the Cincinnati Bengals (1988), four times selected for the Pro Bowl (1986, 1988, 1989, 1993) etc.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Boomer Esiason? It has been estimated that the overall size of his wealth is as much as $15 million, accumulated from his football and TV commentating careers.</p><h3>Boomer Esiason Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Esiason grew up in East Islip, where he attended high school. Then as a student at the University of Maryland, he played in the college football the Terrapins, which he helped win the Atlantic Coast Conference title in 1983 and thus qualified the team for the Florida Citrus Bowl, which they unfortunately lost. He was also twice named All-American.</p><p>Esiason was subsequently chosen 37th in the second round of the 1984 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals, which considerably boosted his net worth, although In his first year as a professional he got little field time. The first game in which he led the team, against the Houston Oilers, the team won 13-3. During his second season Esiason replaced Ken Anderson and threw for 27 touchdowns, forming a great combination with the wide receivers Cris Collinsworth, Eddie Brown and Tim McGee. In 1988, the Bengals in the regular season won 12 of 16 games, winning the AFC Champion and making it to the Super Bowl which they lost to the San Francisco 49ers. However, Esiason’s net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>From 1993 to 1995, Esiason played for the New York Jets, without conspicuous success, partly because of a severe concussion suffered in the 1995 season.</p><p>In 1996 he played for the Arizona Cardinals, before finishing his career in 1997, again playing for the Cincinnati Bengals. The player has been inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.</p><p>Another important source of Boomer Esiason net worth is broadcasting. He started working as a color analyst while still being a professional player. Alongside Brad Nessler, he worked on the World League of American Football broadcast. After he left the professional sport, he decided to work as a color commentator full–time, initially on “Monday Night Football”(1998–2000) on ABC. Later, he was hired by CBS Sports Network. It should be said that Boomer also worked as an analyst in the Westwood One/Dial Global radio network. Since 2007, Esiason together with Craig Carton began hosting a morning drive sports show “Boomer and Carton” (2007 – present). In addition to this, Boomer hosted Miss America Pageant 1998, judged on “Iron Chef America” and landed a role in the film “The Game Plan” (2007) directed by Andy Fickman.</p><p>Boomer is also known for his philanthropic efforts to help those diagnosed with cystic fibrosis – a disease from which his son suffers – launching the Boomer Esiason Foundation to provide grants, scholarships and help to those who are sick with the above mentioned disease.</p><p>Concerning the personal life of Boomer Esiason, he has been married to Cheryl since 1986, and they have two children. Currently, the family resides in New York.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-1347845498309455" crossorigin=anonymous style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiZqKedmr9usdKimKynnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-wear-an-ankle-bracelet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much does it cost to wear an ankle bracelet?">&larr;
