I think butternut gets all the fall glory and poor spaghetti squash, well, it’s just inaccurately named. The name implies that you can sauce it up and twirl it with a fork – and if that’s what you’re craving, maybe go check out one of these recipes. If you’re up for roasted squash strands fluffed up with a fork and stuffed with delicious things, then keep reading! I had this small-ish spaghetti squash that was the perfect size to serve as “bowls” for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This is my new favorite salad… and I don’t throw words like “favorite” or “best ever” around lightly. You may have noticed that I love roasted sweet potatoes in just about any salad (as evident here,&nbsp;here, and here) but this combination – with roasted tomatoes, roasted apples, corn, and a tangy/smoky chipotle dressing – was so good that I made it for dinner two nights in a row. The first night, I made this as&nbsp;a lazy-girl dinner. Jack was out of town so&nbsp;for an easy “by myself” dinner I decided&nbsp;to roast&nbsp;the things (pictured above) that had just arrived&nbsp;in my&nbsp;Farmhouse Delivery…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ok, so I don’t go to school nor do I have a child that goes to school… BUT I still have a healthy appetite for a good snack once 3pm rolls around.&nbsp;Here are some of my favorite heatlhy/healthier go-to treats… If you’re packing lunch boxes, some of these will work there too: Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies (these are made with coconut oil!) Strawberry Avocado Toast (use other fruits if you don’t have strawberries) Maple Walnut Granola Peanut Butter Crispy Treats (a healthier no-marshmallow vegan version) Rainbow Smoothies Carrot Hummus (not sure if your kid will eat collards, but the hummus…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like figs – they’re so sweet and unassuming – but&nbsp;I avoided&nbsp;them&nbsp;for years due to&nbsp;my childhood dislike of Fig Newtons. I was just never a fan of that packaged fig flavor. Later, I came to realize (of course!) that&nbsp;fresh figs are amazing. They’re in season now, and their season is short, so you should go find some. When I have fresh figs, they only seem to last a day (maybe two) so I usually make something really simple with them. Figs, feta, and mint are a&nbsp;delicious combination, so&nbsp;I love them in these little sweet &…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hold your pumpkin bread – I have one last&nbsp;super summery recipe before this season really ends. You can use any summer squash you like here&nbsp;(zucchini or yellow squash are both great), but I found pattypan squash at the farmers market and had to try it! I considered making a totally different pattypan squash recipe by stuffing and baking it, but I didn’t want to turn the oven on. Then I noticed that I had some really stale bread, so this hearty, delicious pattypan squash panzanella was an obvious choice. I’m a HUGE fan of panzanellas, or Italian bread salads (see…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy holiday weekend!&nbsp;If you’re hosting a cookout this Labor Day weekend, here are a&nbsp;few&nbsp;simple (yet super delicious!) veggie recipe ideas. And if you’re attending a cookout this weekend –&nbsp;well, it’s always good to be a bringer&nbsp;especially if you’re the one with the special food requirements. (Who me?) Ok, let’s get started – first we’re going to&nbsp;load up some skewers. (Actually, first, we’re going to make some margaritas). Once you have a&nbsp;drink in hand, get started by marinating the mushrooms. My secret not-so-secret-anymore marinade is so easy – &nbsp;olive oil, balsamic, soy sauce and black pepper. The mushrooms become deeply browned&nbsp;and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Stuffed peppers are one of my go-to summer dinners. In fact, they’re so easy that when I posted this picture on Instagram&nbsp;last week,&nbsp;I got tons of&nbsp;emails asking for the fully measured recipe. Ask and you shall receive, so here it is: my current favorite recipe for vegetarian stuffed peppers. But don’t let the measurements fool you – feel free to eyeball your ingredients&nbsp;if you don’t feel like breaking out the measuring cups. This vegetarian stuffed peppers recipe is simple and customizable! If you don’t have orzo, use couscous. Gluten-free? Millet or quinoa would also work well in place of the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In my opinion, the world cannot have too many quinoa salads. Don’t get me wrong, I love the other grains too – farro, millet, and wheatberries are all lovely – but my real go-to grain is&nbsp;quinoa. I love to make a big batch and keep it on hand, as it’s the perfect&nbsp;catch-all for the vegetables, nuts, and cheeses that I usually have around. Of course, since this salad was destined for a picnic without any silverware, I decided to have my cake (salad?) and eat it too&nbsp;by stuffing it in a veggie wrap. My Veggie Wrap Filling The hearty, fresh…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love pico and I love mango salsa, so I’m not sure why it took so long to come up with the delicious idea to combine the two. This is probably the prettiest salsa I’ve ever made, but I also love&nbsp;the flavor and texture variety that each tomato brings to the table bowl.&nbsp;Cherry tomatoes are sweet, green tomatoes are more tart and firm. I always find myself adding a pinch of sugar to my tomato salsa for balance, but that’s not necessary this time&nbsp;because of the sweet juicy mango. Make a big batch, it’ll keep in your fridge for&nbsp;3-4 days…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy Friday! I hope you have brunch plans this weekend, because today I have&nbsp;a little brunch recipe inspiration to get you started… Last weekend, we flew to California to host&nbsp;this super fun brunch cooking class with Almond Breeze. It was a blast getting to&nbsp;meet & cook with a few fans of the blog (of all ages!). First&nbsp;we made&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;frittata recipe with&nbsp;summer squash, cherry tomatoes and basil. This is a great easy recipe, especially with the abundance of late summer produce that’s in season right now. Of course we couldn’t have an almond milk party without smoothies. At the class, we&nbsp;made&nbsp;super…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>These may be portobello mushroom tacos, but secretly, they’re all about the sauce. It’s a vegan riff on ranch dressing made with cashews, roasted jalapeños, and cucumber, and it’s so good that I have a hard time not eating it all with a spoon! However, resisting it long enough to top it onto these mushroom tacos is totally worth the wait. Cool, creamy, spicy, and bright, it perfectly accents the tangy, meaty grilled mushrooms and fresh garnishes in this recipe. The combination is really terrific – if you try these mushroom tacos once, they’ll have a permanent place in your…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfpa6osY5qZ3Bn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./black-dc-characters-complete-list-and-descriptions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Black DC Characters | Complete List and Descriptions">&larr;
