her outspoken personality, she has kept a part of her fascinating world that she carefully guarded for many years: her marriage of more than five years to the man of her dreams, Carl Thomas Dean.&nbsp;Unlike his superstar wife of many years, Dean has no connection to the spotlight.&nbsp;He is so reclusive that he has never seen Parton perform or perform at public events with her.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it never affected their long-standing relationship, but rather served as a major inspiration to the younger generation, within and beyond the entertainment circle.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=biography-of-carl-thomas-dean></span><strong><span>Biography of Carl Thomas Dean</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Regardless of Parton’s eccentric and influential status, Carl Thomas Dean successfully spent many years with the legendary and reckoning singer.&nbsp;Dean has no more news about Dean’s lonely character, but that never stopped the media from sniffing out his life.&nbsp;Dolly’s husband was born in Nashville, Tennessee on July 20, 1942 to her parents.&nbsp;Edgar Henry Dean (father) and Virginia Ginny Bates Dean (mother).&nbsp;Carl was raised in Tennesse with his two siblings, whose identities are not known to the public.</span></p><p><span>Due to his very private nature, there is no information available online about his childhood, youth, family background, education, and career, although he is said to have run an asphalt paving business in the 1970s in Nashville.&nbsp;At the time, he was living with Dolly in a 23-room mansion outside of Nashville.&nbsp;Carl Thomas Dean, until his retirement, was a businessman who comfortably trained some of Dolly’s nephews and nieces with his and his wife’s earnings.</span></p><p><span>Ever since the couple began spending their lives together, Dean has never slowed down in showing his support for his wife’s burgeoning career.&nbsp;The two men first met when Parton was only eighteen.&nbsp;Carl reportedly met Dolly while driving to Wishville by Washy Laundromat in Nashville.&nbsp;He had stopped his car to advise the singer to stay out of the sun to avoid sunburn and quickly struck up a conversation with her.&nbsp;It was during the conversation that the country legend and her husband, a retired businessman, felt the enchanting spark that has kept them together until now.</span></p><p><span>Almost every aspect of their personality compliments each other.&nbsp;When Dolly isn’t working, she and her husband like each other and do a lot of things together.&nbsp;Sometimes they take mini-trips in their “little camper,” have low-key dinners at their favorite local restaurants, and lunch in the Tennessee countryside.</span></p><p><span>Parton and Carl Thomas Dean were married on May 30, 1966, in a small church in Ringgold, Georgia, USA, after pulling out because Parton’s record label preferred that she remain single.&nbsp;Dolly’s mother (Avie Lee Owens) attended the private ceremony.</span></p><p><span>Their marital relationship did not produce children, and Dolly believes that God wills it that way.&nbsp;Although the mic queen has no children herself, she has plenty of nephews and nieces to indulge herself with.&nbsp;She is also close to her superstar goddaughter, Miley Cyrus, and has donated nearly £100million to children through her nonprofit, Dolly Parton, Imagination Library.</span></p><p><span>Carl and his superstar wife celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a silent vow renewal ceremony in 2016, at their grand home in Nashville.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-of-dolly-partons-husband></span><strong><span>Net worth of Dolly Parton’s husband</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>For the past 50 years, Carl Thomas Dean and his wife loved and supported each other while respecting their autonomy and their careers.</span></p><p><span>Despite Parton’s prominence on the big screens, Thomas was deprived of his personal projects.&nbsp;The retired businessman may not have created as huge a fortune as his wife during her working years, but he is believed to have created wealth in his own way, despite not is not publicly known.</span></p><p><span>To dwell a bit on the country’s iconic superstar, she boasts an impressive net worth estimated at $500 million;&nbsp;which is quite reasonable for a woman of her class.&nbsp;Carl Thomas Dean and his wife are involved in charities as well as known supporters of the Dr. Thomas Foundation.</span></p><p class=postsid
