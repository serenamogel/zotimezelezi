The Martin Scorsese film chronicles the rise of Henry Hill (the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">late, great Ray Liotta</a>), a mafioso turned FBI informant who rose to prominence in the ’60s and ’70s, and also stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in a stellar cast. Based on a true story, the film was an immediate critical and commercial success, and is generally considered to be one of, if not the best film about organized crime in the history of the genre. If you’ve recently seen it for the first time and want something similar, or are a long-term fan of seeing Joe Pesci terrifyingly ask “What’s so funny?” then check out our guide to the 10 best movies like Goodfellas.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-the-godfather-trilogy data-injectable=false>The Godfather Trilogy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=752 data-current-count=1052 data-injectable=true>Francis Ford Coppola’s infamous trilogy about the Corleone family has gone down in cinema history for numerous reasons, from its epic nature to its brutal depiction of the violence of the mafia world in which it’s set. Although there are multiple characters and arcs throughout the three films, it broadly follows the story of Michael Corleone, the son of a famous mob boss who is initially reluctant to get involved in the family business, but ends up becoming one of the most feared men in the city of New York. With a roster of actors that have about a billion awards and nominations to their names (Marlon Brando, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Al Pacino</a>, and Diane Keaton, to name a few), this classic set of films is a must-watch for any lovers of gangster movies.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Donnie Brasco</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=725 data-current-count=1025 data-injectable=true>Another gangster film in which Al Pacino stars, Donnie Brasco also focuses on a real-life story about a mob informant, although in this case, the character is an FBI agent (Johnny Depp) who goes undercover in the Bonanno crime family. Set in the wilds of New York in the 1970s, Depp’s character takes on the alias of Donnie Brasco, an alleged jewel thief from Florida. He wriggles into the life of an aging mafioso named Lefty (Pacino), eventually gaining his trust so that he’s introduced to the main players in the family. As he delves further into a life of crime, he realizes he’s blurring the lines between the mob and his job, and also almost certainly sentencing Lefty to death. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brutal and brilliant</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Irishman</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=989 data-injectable=true>This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three-hour epic</a> was only released a few years ago but combines some of the biggest names in gangster films to create an ensemble cast that makes the mouth water. Another Scorsese flick, it stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino, so you know it’s full of people who live and breathe the genre. The Irishman (also based on a true story) spans decades and is about the life of Frank Sheeran (De Niro), a one-time truck driver who eventually becomes a hitman associated with a mob boss named Russell Bufalino (Pesci), who in turn is entangled with the powerful union head and center of mysterious conspiracy theories Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). An epic in every sense of the word.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scarface</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=798 data-current-count=1098 data-injectable=true>Cocaine, guns, and gangsters: Scarface is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all-time crime classic</a>, buoyed by a great script, a brilliant performance from lead Al Pacino, and plenty of gratuitous violence. The film chronicles the life of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who arrives in Miami with practically nothing but the clothes on his back. We see Montana eventually work his way up to being the head of a huge drug syndicate, but not before a whole lot of excellent fight scenes and enough tension to snap a steel beam. The film culminates in a massive shootout, in which Pacino utters the now iconic line, “Say hello to my little friend,” before spraying his enemies with a hail of gunfire. The film is also famous for being Michelle Pfeiffer’s breakout role, and she’s excellent as the love interest.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Once Upon a Time in America</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=803 data-current-count=1103 data-injectable=true>The original American cut of this film was reduced to 139 minutes and is seen as a critical and commercial failure, but the “European cut,” as it came to be known, spanned nearly four hours, and is widely seen as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the greatest gangster epics of our time</a>. Based on a novel by Harry Grey called The Hoods, Once Upon a Time in America follows the lives of David “Noodles” Aaronson and Maximilian “Max” Bercovicz, two best friends who become the two biggest Jewish gangsters in New York City’s underworld. While there is plenty of intrigue and violence, the movie is also famous for its exploration of childhood friendships, betrayal, and love. With that said, it is primarily a gangster flick, so if you love Goodfellas, you’re sure to adore this film.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Gangster</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=821 data-current-count=1121 data-injectable=true>Starring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Denzel Washington in one of his most captivating roles</a>, and loosely based on the life of Harlem heroin (and other drugs) mob boss Frank Lucas, American Gangster was directed by Ridley Scott, and in a sparkling career is one of the filmmaker’s best. It begins in 1968, with Lucas taking over the mantle left by his now-deceased boss, mob head Ellsworth “Bumpy” Johnson. The film is not only notable for its intriguing plot, but also for highlighting how gangsters used American service planes returning from Vietnam to smuggle heroin back into the States, and just how large a proportion of the NYPD were on the take from criminal organizations. On that note, the police get a bit more air time in this movie, too, with half of the plot dedicated to the officers who eventually took Lucas down.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Heat</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=632 data-current-count=932 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">De Niro and Pacino once again steal the show</a> in this psychological crime drama about the battle between LAPD detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and career criminal Neil McCauley (De Niro). As Hanna chases after McCauley, the two men’s lives become increasingly entangled, leading to lots of intrigue and plenty of tense scenes that will have you clutching the edge of your sofa. The film culminates with a mad chase on the LAX runway, and despite its long runtime, it’s an absolutely engrossing watch. A little more subtle than some of the others on this list, but nonetheless a great watch for Goodfellas fans.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Casino</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=941 data-injectable=true>In the States, organized crime and legalized gambling go hand-in-hand, and no film explores this link better than Casino. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wildly successful movie</a> chronicles how Ace (Robert De Niro), a Jewish American gambler, is asked by a Chicago crime syndicate to oversee the Tangiers Casino in Vegas. Once there, Ace begins making even more money and skimming some off the top, but as he dives deeper into life in the casino, his personal relationships begin to break down, as does the mob’s influence in Vegas. The film ends with Ace unhappy at the sanitized nature of the new Vegas, and with him back where he started as an odds handicapper.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>A Bronx Tale</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=646 data-current-count=946 data-injectable=true>In many ways, Goodfellas is a coming-of-age story as much as it’s a gangster tale, and the same could be said of this classic. Based on a play of the same name, A Bronx Tale follows the story of Calogero, an Italian-American boy who becomes entangled with the local mob after he refuses to rat out a local mafia boss for a murder, much to his hardworking, straight-laced father’s horror. The film charts how Calogero toes the line between the two worlds he now inhabits, while also delving into the complexities of race relations in the Bronx in the ’60s. An astounding watch that’s as violent as it is touching and funny.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Get Carter</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=871 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Caine stars</a> as the infamous Jack Carter, a London-based gangster who returns to his hometown of Newcastle in Northwest England after his brother supposedly died in an accident. Suspecting that he was murdered, Carter begins going through the local crime community in an attempt to find out the truth and exact vengeance on those who he believes killed his brother. Dark, brutal, and smart, this British crime thriller is full of twists and turns, and Caine is truly magnetic in the lead role, keeping your eyes glued to the screen even as he commits heinous acts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWZ9bq7ErKtmpZ%2Brtqa%2FjKWgpJ1dnLywsMWeo6WZo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eberjey-pajamas-holiday-gift-6889154.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eberjey Pajamas Make Great Holiday Gift for Anyone on Your List">&larr;
