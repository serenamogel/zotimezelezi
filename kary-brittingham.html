Kary Brittingham is a Mexican beauty whose maiden name is Karyson A “Holmes.” Kary married twice and later took the surnames “Sendra” and “Brittingham.”</p><h2><span id=Kary_Brittingham_Career_and_Education>Kary Brittingham <span class="TextRun SCXW118150082 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW118150082 BCX8">Career and Education</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW118150082 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Kary had a difficult relationship with her alcoholic mother as a child, and depression and anxiety lived rent-free in her head. But she didn’t let the negativity get to her. Kary persevered, studied marketing at Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business, and is now a reality star and successful jewelry store owner. She hopes to achieve “financial independence” through her jewelry business someday.</p><p>Kary worked in sales/marketing at Advanced Global Communication for over 6 years before opening Kamo by Kary.</p><p>Kary was available on Cameo @karybritt in 2021, where she took requests for $50.</p><p>Kary has also appeared on Celebrity Page (2019) and Below Deck Mediterranean (in case you missed it) (2017).</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Kary_Brittingham><span class="TextRun SCXW94823851 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW94823851 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Kary Brittingham?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW94823851 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Kary Brittingham, the owner of the jewelry line “Kamo by Kary,” had a net worth of $1.5 million to $5 million in 2021.

He is a year younger than Kary and has his birthday on August 23. Stace had been working as a Senior Marketing Manager at a food and beverage company called Deoleo (North America) for over 4 years as of 2021. Before that, he spent over 6 years as a manager for Bimbo Bakeries USA. He was also a co-founder of Globalmex Trading, LLC.</p><p>Stace earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business. This was also the college where Kary studied. So perhaps Kary and her first husband met here.</p><p>We could tell Stace was a scenic person just by looking at his Facebook profile @stace.sendra. He had filled his photos with mesmerizing natural beauty and his children.</p><p>Kary Brittingham is the type of fiery woman who isn’t afraid to speak her mind. Eduardo Brittingham, her husband, and she were both in their second marriage. Eduardo was the CEO of the social media app Tu Familia, which connected and empowered Latin communities around the world.</p><p>They married in April 2009 and have been happily married for over a decade. However, Eduardo didn’t appear much on RHOD Season 5 by early 2021, raising the question: Were they still together?</p><p>Speculatively, Kary removed the title “wife” from her IG bio at the time, which could be a hint to something. However, many people believed that RHOD would be more focused on Kary’s mother and children, so Eduardo received less screen time.</p><p>Kary announced her and Eduardo’s divorce ahead of the RHOD reunion episode, which will air on May 4, 2021. “I want you to know that Eduardo and I have made the very difficult decision to separate,” she wrote on Instagram. Kary then expressed her appreciation for Eduardo’s role as a father to their four children. They were, after all, embarking on their new journey as co-parents together.</p><h2><span id=Kary_Brittingham8217s_Children>Kary Brittingham’s Children</span></h2><p>Kary Brittingham has four children, all of whom have appeared on RHOD. She has three children from her first marriage, Sofia, Olivia, and Alex Sendra (a jewelry designer), and one daughter from her second marriage, Eduardo, named Isabella Brittingham.</p><p>Olivia’s journey to her freshman year of college was featured in RHOD season 4. In addition, Olivia’s struggle with depression and anxiety, as well as her determination to share her experiences to help others, became a focal point of the show.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jean Guillaume Auguste Lugol</a></h3>Jean Guillaume Auguste Lugol estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
