The cancellation came as a surprise, as Dobbs had ended his last episode with his standard “Join us here tomorrow” and “See you then” appeal. The promised ‘tomorrow’ never arrived, as Fox News media canceled the show on February 5, 2021.</p><p>The news shocked everyone, including Dobbs’ fans and other media outlets, because he was one of television’s highest-rated hosts, and his show had been running smoothly since 1980. However, the network provided no explanation for the cancellation other than to state that it was part of its post-election programming.</p><h2>Reason for the cancellation</h2><p>However, the network provided no significant reason for the cancellation other than to reiterate that it was part of its post-election programming changes. While the network declined to provide specifics, many speculated that the cancellation had something to do with his involvement in a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit. A voting software company, Smartmatic, had filed a defamation suit against Fox News and its three hosts, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro, and Lou Dobbs, just a day before his show was canceled.</p><p>The company accused the network and Dobbs, a Donald Trump supporter, of spreading false information about their roles in the election. However, Fox News did not comment on whether this was the ultimate reason for the abrupt cancellation.</p><p>Despite the show’s cancellation, Dobbs remains under contract with Fox News. The Harvard graduate, on the other hand, is unlikely to appear on the network. He expressed his displeasure with the show’s decision by retweeting tweets from his followers opposing or criticizing Fox and its recent changes. Dobbs’ net worth and salary were undeniably impacted after Fox News canceled his well-known show.</p><h2>In addition, a career includes CNN</h2><p>Dobbs, who was born on September 24, 1945, has worked in journalism for over four decades. The conservative commentator began his career as a reporter and anchor for several radio news networks, including KBLU and KING-TV.</p><p>Ted Turner contacted him during CNN’s formation year in 1979 and invited him to join the growing media company. By 1980, he had risen to the position of chief economics correspondent. In 2001, he began hosting Moneyline, a business news program.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lou-dobbs-tonight-cancelled-fox-news-1.jpg><p>Later, he left CNN to launch the astronomical news website Space.com, but he quickly returned to anchor Lou Dobbs Tonight’s news program. However, Dobb’s viewers were taken aback in 2009 when he abruptly resigned from CNN. His departure was said to be due to disagreements with the management team. After CNN, he returned to radio, where he hosted his nationally syndicated show for three years, from 2009 to 2012.</p><p>Meanwhile, after an acrimonious departure from CNN, he quickly joined a rival TV station. In 2010, he returned to the newsroom as the anchor of Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox News Network, just a year after leaving CNN.</p><h2>The Net Worth of Lou Dobbs</h2><p>His work for prestigious news networks such as CNN and Fox News earned him fame and a large salary, which he used to increase his net worth. <strong>Lou Dobbs has a net worth of $20 million as of August 2023</strong>&nbsp;and a salary of $5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>He owns a 300-acre horse farm and a $1.2 million home on Eagle Terrace in West Palm Beach’s Ibis Golf & Country Club. Dobbs and his wife, Debi Segura, live on their farm. In addition, he is the author of 11 books, including “The Next Business Frontier,” “Upheaval,” and “Putin’s Gambit: a Novel.”</p><p>The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has honored the political commentator with the George Foster Peabody Award and the Emmy Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Lou Dobbs</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>Sep 24, 1945</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>77 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height/How tall?<br></strong></td><td>6 feet 2 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Journalist</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father Name</strong></td><td>Frank Dobbs</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother Name</strong></td><td>Lydia Mae</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Married?</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Gay?<br></strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$16 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Debi Segura</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lou Dobbs</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxsLHSZqOorV2ZvKOu0mafmq6VYq6nwMSrZJ%2BnqGKvtr%2FIp5ysq12Yrq%2BvxKWcnWWYnsBuv8eormg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./india-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="India Love">&larr;
