She played in San Diego coffeehouses, before signing a deal with Atlantic Records and releasing her first record, Pieces of You, in 1995. Along with selling more than 30 million albums, Jewel is a published writer, activist and actress, with screen credits that include <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/ang-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ang Lee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ang Lee</a>'s 1999 Civil War drama, Ride with the Devil.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel Kilcher was born on May 23, 1974, in Payson, Utah, and grew up in Alaska. She began her musical career at the age of six, joining her parents, singer-songwriters Atz Kilcher and Nedra Carroll, on stage. After her parents divorced, Jewel continued to tour for several years with her father, who taught her how to yodel—a singing technique that Jewel has used in many of her own songs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At age 15, Jewel made a big career jump; she began performing as a solo act and won a vocal scholarship to Interlochen, a private school in Michigan dedicated to the arts. While there, she began writing songs and took up the guitar. Jewel later moved to San Diego, California, to live with her mother, and eventually branched out on her own, living in a van for a time as she tried to make it as a performer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her impressive vocal range and poetic lyrics, Jewel found success playing at coffeehouses in the San Diego area. Her first steady gig was at the Innerchange in Pacific Beach. While performing there, she was discovered by a music manager and record company representatives, who were impressed with her raw talent. Jewel signed a deal with Atlantic Records in 1994.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Albums and Songs</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Pieces of You'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel's first album, Pieces of You, was released the following year, but it wasn't until 1996 that the album really took off. She toured constantly to promote her music, serving as the opening act for two musical legends: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bob-dylan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Dylan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/neil-young data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Young" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Neil Young</a>. Her persistence began to pay off as her single "Who Will Save Your Soul" became a huge hit, climbing to No. 11 on Billboard's Top 100 chart. Two other songs from Pieces of You, "You Were Meant for Me" and "Foolish Games," were also well-received. With its folk and pop sensibility, the album went on to sell around 11 million copies. Listeners were captivated by the heartfelt emotions Jewel conveyed in her songs.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Spirit,' 'This Way'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel's second album, Spirit, released in 1998, showcased her talents as a folk music performer. Filled with ballads and simple instrumentation, the album included the popular songs "Hands" and "Standing Still." After releasing the Christmas album Joy: A Holiday Collection (1999), Jewel returned with a lighter, more pop-based sound with 2001's This Way, which featured the title track and "Break Me" as singles.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'0304'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel went on to reinvent herself in 2003 with 0304, making a foray into dance music, much to the surprise of her longtime fans. The album debuted at the No. 2 spot on the Billboard 200 chart and featured the hit single "Intuition." Not only did Jewel sound different, she looked different too, wearing sexier, edgier clothing in her music videos and on stage.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Goodbye Alice in Wonderland,' 'Perfectly Clear'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2006, Jewel returned to her roots with the personal, folk-influenced album Goodbye Alice in Wonderland, which met with mild success. In November 2007, Jewel embarked on another musical transformation when she signed with Valory Records and began working on her first country album. Perfectly Clear hit retail stores in June 2008 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Album Chart. The album included the hit "Stronger Woman," which made it into the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Lullaby,' 'Sweet and Wild,' 'The Merry Goes 'Round'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 2009, Jewel announced that she was working on a new album. Lullaby, a collection of new songs and covers of popular nursery rhymes, was released in May 2009. The album's first single, "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," a remake of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judy-garland data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Judy Garland" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Judy Garland</a> classic, was released on iTunes in March 2009. Her next album, the country-flavored Sweet and Wild (2010), featured the single "Stay Here Forever," which also appeared on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy Valentine's Day. Jewel then revisited the "children's songs for all ages" theme with The Merry Goes 'Round (2011).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Picking Up the Pieces'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After releasing her Greatest Hits and Let It Snow: A Holiday Collection in 2013, Jewell revisited her folk roots once again with 2015's Picking Up the Pieces. Along with featuring several songs that were familiar to fans from her live performances, the album included a collaboration with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dolly-parton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dolly Parton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dolly Parton</a> on "My Father's Daughter." Jewel later teased the arrival of her 12th studio album with the release of the songs "No More Tears" in late 2019 and "Grateful" in spring 2020.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Film and TV Appearances</h2><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Rides with the Devil,' 'Platinum Hit'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel made her big-screen debut in the Ang Lee Civil War drama Rides with the Devil in 1999, acting alongside <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/tobey-maguire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tobey Maguire" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tobey Maguire</a> and Skeet Ulrich. On the small screen, she appeared on such programs as The Lyons Den, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Las Vegas. Additionally, she immersed herself in the world of reality TV competitions by serving as a judge on shows like Nashville Star and Platinum Hit.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Ring of Fire,' 'A Fixer Upper Mystery'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2012, Jewel announced that she would be playing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/june-carter-cash data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="June Carter Cash" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">June Carter Cash</a>—the second wife of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/johnny-cash data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnny Cash" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnny Cash</a>—in Lifetime's Ring of Fire.

She followed with Chasing Down the Dawn: Stories from the Road (2000), a collection of musings and reflections from her journals over the years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2015, the artist published a more traditional memoir, Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story, which included the revelations that her father had been abusive and that her mom had embezzled money while serving as her business manager.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Charities and Activism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jewel has also devoted her time to helping others.
