By opting-in to or participating in any of our Programs, you accept and agree to these Terms, including, without limitation, your agreement to resolve any disputes with us through binding, individual-only arbitration, as detailed in Section 18 (Dispute Resolution) below. This Agreement is limited to the Program and is not intended to modify other Terms or the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Policy</a> that may govern the relationship between you and Sporked in other contexts.</li><li>User Opt-In: The Program allows users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by affirmatively opting in to the Program, such as through online enrollment forms.&nbsp; Regardless of the opt-in method you utilized to join the Program, you agree that this Agreement applies to your participation in the Program and you acknowledge and agree that your information may be shared with third-party service providers who help us administer the Program. By participating in the Program, you agree to receive auto-dialed or prerecorded marketing mobile messages at the phone number associated with your opt-in. While you consent to receive messages sent using an auto-dialer, the foregoing shall not be interpreted to suggest or imply that any or all of our mobile messages are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “auto-dialer”). Message and data rates may apply.</li><li>User Opt-Out: If you do not wish to continue participating in the Program or no longer agree to this Agreement, you agree to reply STOP to any mobile message from Sporked to opt out of the Program. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt-out. You understand and agree that the foregoing option is the only reasonable method of opting out. You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words other than the word STOP or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out.</li><li>Duty to Notify and Indemnify: If at any time you intend to stop using the mobile telephone number that has been used to subscribe to the Program, including canceling your service plan or selling or transferring the phone number to another party, you agree that you will complete the User Opt-Out process set forth above prior to ending your use of the mobile telephone number. You understand and agree that your agreement to do so is a material part of these Terms. You further agree that, if you discontinue the use of your mobile telephone number without notifying Sporked of such change, you agree that you will be responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities incurred by Sporked, or any party that assists in the delivery of the mobile messages, as a result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later assigned that mobile telephone number. This duty and Agreement shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs. YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD US HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO NOTIFY US OF A CHANGE IN THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY UNDER THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 47 U.S.C. § 227, OR SIMILAR STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, AND ANY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER RESULTING FROM US ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT YOU AT THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU PROVIDED.</li><li>Program Description: Without limiting the scope of the Program, users that opt in to the Program can expect to receive messages concerning the marketing and sale of products, services, and events.</li><li>Cost and Frequency: Message and data rates may apply. The Program involves recurring mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent periodically based on your interaction with Sporked.&nbsp;</li><li>MMS Disclosure: The Program will send SMS TMs (terminating messages) if your mobile device does not support MMS messaging.&nbsp;</li><li>Our Disclaimer of Warranty: The Program is offered on an “as-is” basis and may not be available in all areas at all times and may not continue to work in the event of product, software, or coverage change or other changes made by your wireless carrier. We will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any mobile messages connected with this Program. Delivery of mobile messages is subject to effective transmission from your wireless service provider/network operator and is outside of Sporked’s control.</li><li>Participant Requirements: You must have a wireless device of your own, capable of two-way messaging, be using a participating wireless carrier, and be a wireless service subscriber with text messaging service. Not all cellular phone providers carry the necessary service to participate.

The Third-Party Sites are not under the control of Sporked and Sporked is not responsible for the content available on the Third-Party Sites. Such links do not imply Sporked’s endorsement of information or material on any Third-Party Site and Sporked disclaims all liability with regard to your access to and use of such Third-Party Sites.

In Sporked’s sole discretion, any Submitted Content may be included in the Service in whole or in part in modified form. In addition, Sporked and its designees shall have the right, but not the obligation, in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Submitted Content that is available via the Service that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable including, but not limited to, being unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene, or violating any party’s intellectual property or other rights.</li><li>You acknowledge that your Submitted Content is your sole responsibility. You agree that, under no circumstances, will Sporked be liable in any way for any Submitted Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Submitted Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use or distribution of any Submitted Content transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.</li><p id=DMCA-Notice>8. <strong>DMCA Notice</strong></p><li>Sporked has adopted a policy that provides for the suspension and/or termination of any user who is found to have infringed on the rights of Sporked or of a third party, or otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or regulations.

You can also mail your DMCA request to:</p><p>Adam Kaller</p><p>Mythical Entertainment, LLC</p><p>450 N Roxbury Dr # 800, Beverly Hills, CA 90210</p><p>Mailing DMCA notices may delay the processing of your request. Only copyright complaints should be sent to the Designated Agent. No other communications will be accepted or responded to.</p><p>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements above, your DMCA notice may not be valid and may not be acknowledged. Once proper notice is received by the Designated Agent, it is Sporked’s policy:</p><ul><li>To remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li><li>To notify the content provider, member, or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material; and</li><li>That repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Sporked will terminate such repeat offender’s access to the Service.&nbsp;</li></ul><li>Counter-Notice: If you believe that the material that was removed or to which access has been disabled is either not infringing, or you believe that you have the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, you must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:</li><ul><li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li><li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li><li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li><li>Your name, address, and telephone number; and</li><li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of federal district court in the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which you may be found and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the initial notification of alleged infringement.</li></ul><p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Sporked may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member, or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Sporked’s discretion.</p><p>9. <strong>Idea Submissions</strong></p><li>We welcome feedback from our users and appreciate your comments regarding our Service.

THIS PROVISION SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT ON SPORKED’s CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION SET FORTH BELOW.</p><p>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, in part “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release that, if known by him or her would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”</p><p id=Termination>15. <strong>Termination</strong></p><p>We may terminate these Terms, deactivate your account, and/or your permission to use the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, if (i) you commit any breach of these Terms, (ii) we discontinue the Service, or (iii) we are prevented from providing the Service for any reason.</p><p>Furthermore, we reserve the right to change, edit, suspend, delete, and/or cancel any part of the Service, your account, and/or your access to the Service at any time with or without notice to you: (i) if required by law, or (ii) due to an event beyond our control.</p><p>On termination of these Terms for any reason: (i) all rights granted to you under these Terms will cease immediately, (ii) you must immediately cease all activities authorized by these Terms (including your use of the Service), and (iii) you acknowledge that we may restrict your access to the Service. Sections 10–19 will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p><p id=Communication-Between-Us>16. <strong>Communication Between Us</strong></p><p>If you wish to contact us in writing, or if any condition in these Terms require you to give us notice in writing, you can send this to us by email or as otherwise indicated in Section 21 (Contact Us) at the bottom of these Terms. For DMCA notices, please see Section 8 (DMCA Notice).</p><p>If we have to contact you or give you notice in writing, we may do so by email or using any other contact details you provide to us.</p><p id=Governing-Law>17. <strong>Governing Law</strong></p><p>These Terms and any matter arising out of or relating to these Terms, and any claim, cause of action, controversy, or matter in dispute between you and us, whether sounding in contract, tort, statute, regulation, or otherwise, shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of California in the United States, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to any choice or conflict of laws principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction).</p><p id=Dispute-Resolution>18. <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p><p>User Concerns. Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user’s satisfaction by contacting us at the contact details in Section 21 (Contact Us) below.&nbsp;</p><p>Arbitration Procedures. In the event your concern cannot be resolved informally, you and Sporked agree that, except as provided in Section 18(e) below, all Disputes (each a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) and under the terms set forth in these Terms. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 18 (Dispute Resolution) and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section will control and prevail.</p><p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 18(e) below, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state, or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Sporked will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given, and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, (i) you and Sporked may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p><p>IN THE CASE OF ARBITRATION AND WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR HEARING, BUT THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. ARBITRATOR DECISIONS ARE ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT ORDER AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p><li>Location. The arbitration will take place in the County and City of Los Angeles, California, unless the parties agree to video, phone, or Internet connection appearances.&nbsp;</li><li>Limitations. You and Sporked agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Sporked and you individually. YOU AND SPORKED AGREE THAT (i) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (ii) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (iii) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.</li><li>Exceptions to Arbitration. You and Sporked agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (i) any Excluded Dispute; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</li><li>Arbitration Fees. If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we initiate arbitration for a Claim, we will pay the costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.</li><li>Severability. You and Sporked agree that if any portion of this Section is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 18(e)), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 18(e) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor Sporked will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 18(e) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County and City of Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you and Sporked agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</li><p id=Additional-Important-Terms>19. <strong>Additional Important Terms</strong></p><p id=Additional-Important-Terms>Assignment. The rights granted to you under these Terms may not be assigned without Sporked’s prior written consent, and any attempted unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.</p><p>Severability. Except as otherwise provided in Section 18(g), if any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then that portion shall be severed, and the remainder of the Terms shall be given full force and effect.</p><p>Attorneys’ Fees. In the event any litigation or arbitration is brought by either party in connection with these Terms, except as otherwise provided in Section 18(f), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in any legal action relating to these Terms.</p><p>No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect our right to enforce the same provision at a later time. An express waiver by Sporked of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms shall not be understood as a waiver of your obligation to comply with the same provision, condition, or requirement at a later time.</p><p>Equitable Remedies. You acknowledge and agree that Sporked would be irreparably damaged if the terms of these Terms were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to any breach of these Terms, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.</p><p>Entire Agreement. These Terms, including the documents referenced in these Terms, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Sporked with respect to the Service and supersedes any and all prior agreements between you and Sporked relating to the Service.</p><p>Transfer. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organization, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms.</p><p id=Changes-to-These-Terms>20. <strong>Changes to These Terms</strong></p><p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms at any time. As applicable, we will notify you of material changes to these Terms when you next access the Service (we may also email you about any material changes to these Terms). We reserve the right at any time and from time-to-time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part of it) with or without notice.</p><p id=Contact-Us>21. <strong>Contact Us</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or comments relating to the Service or these Terms, please contact us at <a href=#>info@sporked.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BpsrO50maaqKaUnsGqu82sZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amanda-berry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amanda Berry - Story, Daughter &amp;amp; Facts">&larr;
